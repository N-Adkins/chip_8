# chip_8

This is a simple CHIP-8 interpreter / emulator project that I'm making to try to help me learn the Rust language, so don't bully me **too** hard for the code.

Plays most ROMs that I could find, supports sound. Scoreboards are kind of broken, looking into it. Still doesn't pass some of the more complicated instruction tests but is more or less functional.
